# Chatbot_WS

Hello! My name is William Shaoul. As of 9/23/2204, I am a Junior Computer Engineering Major at the University of Florida.

This is the chatbot I developed during my Summer 2024 internship at a climate tech company in Dublin, Ireland. It is a web-based application that allowed me to learn the fundamentals of Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in conjunction with OpenAI's API.

Initially, the database connected to the chatbot had the waste metrics of 15+ Irish hospitals. To proect the IP and identity of the company I workeed for, I have changed the data and theme of the application to make it more generic and open-source.

Hope you enjoy checking it out!
